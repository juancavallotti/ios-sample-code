ios-sample-code
===============

A bunch of iOS projects with sample code on how to get things done.

These projects were created on a training course as practice projects but each one illustrate various techniques for iOS 5 development.

Caution! The code may be undocumented and partially in spanish, you may use it for learning purposes. Use it on commercial projects at your own risk.

Have Fun!
